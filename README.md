This project was completed as a test task.

## Working conditions for checking the promotional code.

The input field accepts an eight-digit code consisting of paired digits, which can be:
- both are even
- both are odd
- even and odd
After entering the promotional code into the input, the cost of the promotional code should be returned to the user, depending on the combination of numbers.
- If a pair of even digits is separated by a pair of odd digits, such a promotional code has a cost of UAH 1000.
